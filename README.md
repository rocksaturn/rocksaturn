Hi! I'm Zuhal, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student passionate about:

- Embedded systems and circuit design  
- Autonomous technologies and robotics (ROS, AI, control systems)  
- Electric vehicles (dreaming of Tesla's Saturn Project)  
- Python, C++, MATLAB, Arduino, ROS2

Currently working on small sensor-based projects and simulations.  
Goal: Build intelligent systems that move the world forward.
